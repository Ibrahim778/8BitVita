# X1Vita

**Download**: https://github.com/Ibrahim778/X1Vita/releases

**Enable the plugin:**

1. Add X1Vita.skprx to taiHEN's config (ux0:/tai/config.txt) or (ur0:/tai/config.txt):
	```
	*KERNEL
	ux0:tai/X1Vita.skprx
	```
2. You need to refresh the config.txt by rebooting or through VitaShell.

**Using it for the first time (pairing the controller):**

1. Go to Settings -> Devices -> Bluetooth Devices
2. Press the pair on the controller for about 3-4 seconds, until the logo blinks very quickly
3. The controller will then connect and be paired (You may get a message saying "Do you want to connect to (blank)" just press ok and ignore the error)

**Using it once paired (see above):**
1. Just press the xbox button and it will connect to the Vita

**Note**: If you are using multiple controllers and one controller is already connected you need to disable and reenable bluetooth for any other controller to pair and work.

**Note**: If you use Mai, don't put the plugin inside ux0:/plugins because Mai will load all stuff you put in there...

This plugin is **not** compatible with the other ds vita plugins yet!!!!

Made for the kyuhen homebrew contest.
